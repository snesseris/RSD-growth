This is an RSD likelihood for the MontePython code, based on the "Gold-2018" data set of arXiv:1806.10822. The code was first presented in the paper arXiv: 2006.01762. If you use the code please cite my papers 1806.10822, 2006.01762 and the papers for each data point. A bib file and a txt file containing a table with the data are also provided. 

Installation: Copy the files found in /data, /input and /likelihoods in the corresponding Montepython directories. A test script is also provided.

What's new:
* Version 1.0 (June 1st, 2020): Initial version of the code.
